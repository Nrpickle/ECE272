@W: MT529 :"c:\lscc\diamond\3.1_x64\bin\nt64\lab6_test\section6_testfinaldesign\source\clock_counter.v":11:2:11:7|Found inferred clock Sec6_Top|clk_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including counter_1.count[12:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
