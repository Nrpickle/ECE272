ECE272
======

This is a repo for my ECE 272 Code for Winter Term 2014.

The code was written in Lattice Diamond for the LCMX02-7000HE FPGA.

This is a personal backup of my code. If you wish to reference it, feel free. However, in the end it is important to do your own work. You will learn nothing from copy pasting mine.
